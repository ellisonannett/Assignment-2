                        liked the idea of having a bicycle wheel in my studio. I enjoyed looking at it, just as I
                        enjoyed looking at the flames dancing in a fireplace. It was like having a fireplace in my
                        studio.”</span>

                        store in 1915. He signed and dated the shovel before suspending it from the ceiling of his
                        studio for display. The title, <i>In Advance of the Broken Arm</i>, humorously references the
                        shovel's intended use.</span>

                        upside-down urinal titled <i>Fountain</i>, signed “R. Mutt, 1917,” to the unjuried Society of
                        Independent Artists’ salon in New York, which promised to accept any artwork with a paid fee.
                        The board, suspecting a prank, rejected <i>Fountain</i> as not being true art. In response,
                        Duchamp, a board member, resigned in protest.</span>

                    <span>Marcel Duchamp transformed an ordinary, mass-produced bottle rack into an artwork by designating it as such. Known as <i>Bottle Rack</i>, its original function was redefined by Duchamp's act of selection. When he moved to New York in 1915, he left the piece with his sister, who had discarded it by the time Duchamp later requested it. However, the concept behind <i>Bottle Rack</i> persisted, as its status as a ready-made inherently questioned originality due to its industrial production. Duchamp subsequently acquired and authorized new versions of the work.</span>
